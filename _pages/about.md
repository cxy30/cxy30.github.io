My name is Xiaoyu Chen. I am a forth-year PhD student in Peking University. I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Liwei Wang. Before that, I finished my undergraduate study with honors at Peking University. My research interests lie in reinforcement learning and online learning. For reinforcement learning, I am interested in designing efficient exploration algorithms with theoretical guarantees. For online learning, I mainly focus on bandit learning.
