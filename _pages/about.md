My name is Xiaoyu Chen. I am a PhD graduate from Peking University. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Liwei Wang](http://www.liweiwang-pku.com). Before that, I finished my undergraduate study with honors at Peking University. My research interests lie in reinforcement learning and online learning. For reinforcement learning, I am interested in designing efficient exploration algorithms with theoretical guarantees. For online learning, I mainly focus on bandit learning.

* (ICLR 2022 spotlight) [Understanding Domain Randomization for Sim-to-real Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03239)  
**Xiaoyu Chen**\*, Jiachen Hu\*,  Chi Jin, Lihong Li, Liwei Wang  
**Highlight**: We model the simulator in sim-to-real transfer as a set of MDPs with tunable parameters. We prove that zero-shot sim-to-real transfer can succeed under mild assumptions if we use domain randomization methods with a memory augmented policy model.

* (ICLR 2022 spotlight) [Near-Optimal Reward-Free Exploration for Linear Mixture MDPs with Plug-in Solver](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03244)  
**Xiaoyu Chen**, Jiachen Hu, Lin F. Yang, Liwei Wang  
**Highlight**: We formulate the reward-free setting with a plug-in solver, in which the agent learns a model in the exploration phase and demands that any planning algorithm on the learned model can give a near-optimal policy. We provide efficient learning algorithms with near-optimal sample complexity bounds.
